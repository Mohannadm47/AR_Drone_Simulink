ARDrone for Simulink DevKit_V1

The development kit consists of blocks and examples for the simulation and real-time Wi-Fi control of the Parrot AR Drone 2.0. 

The simulation blocks are based on models of the vehicle derived via system identification. The Wi-Fi control blocks are capable of sending commands to the drone and reading the states of the drone in real-time.

The examples provide a framework for the control and guidance of the vehicle. These examples enable velocity and position control, waypoint tracking, and mission execution for the AR.Drone in both simulation and Wi-Fi control.

This development kit was produced in the context of the 2013 MathWorks Summer Research Internship project. For more information about the overall project to develop an automated autonomous emergency response system see:
